	<summary>Explanation</summary>
	
	For the first post of the second roll of the year is this interesting picture. Normally, I wouldn't be showing a square picture, but this one happens to be the first picture on the roll. One thing that tends to happen with the first picture on a roll is that the picture is overexposed entirely leading into it. This is just a function of loading the roll in a light filled environment and then advancing to the spot. You won't always get a cut off picture like this, but you also will from time to time.<br><br>

	In terms of this picture, it's a pretty simple one. The major focus was supposed to be the drummer to the left side of the image, but it got taken out by the beginning of the roll as explained. What's left over is not great but not bad either. Clearly, the focus is close towards the drummer leading to both guitarists being out of focus.<br><br>

	In terms of it now being a 3 element picture, I think this one works pretty well. I like the two contrasting lines, one created by the 2 guitarists/vocalists and the keyboard player to the back. The other line being the cymbal. I intentionally lined up the cymbal to be oriented with the right side just above the 2nd guitarist's head and I think it works well to create those crossing lines.<br><br>

	Before continuing, I want to acknowledge the musicians real quick. This picture, as the title says is of Midnight Snack, a small pretty new band from Austin. They have a really chill and easygoing sound that's fun and easy to listen to. They aren't the most active performers on stage, preferring to be pretty stationary, but they definitely give off a really jovial and friendly atmosphere.<br><br>

	Back to the picture. Originally, the cymbal is supposed to be offset more to the right of the frame since the drummer is supposed to take up about a third of the frame. That said, I think I might like this more with it front and center. The stand creates a natural left/right split while the cymbal itself makes a nice top/bottom split.<br><br>

	Normally, I ignore the first picture on a roll because it's usually some throwaway test picture. But when I saw the negative for this one I wanted to scan it and give it a chance. Of the few pictures I took of Midnight Snack, this one was the best so I'm glad I did. It also ends up working pretty well as a picture. I'll reserve some statements on the film and process and some other qualities for the roll picture later so I think I'll just call this post here.
