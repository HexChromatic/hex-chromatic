The 2nd roll of the year is also Portra 400, but this time it's pushed 2 stops. As before, the grain is even rougher than when pushed 1 stop, but the color change isn't as dramatic as I expected. There's definitely some level of yellowing happening. There's also a bit of desaturation of some colors, especially warmer colors. Overall though, it seems like Portra can take a couple stops of pushing without significant changes which is a useful thing to know.

In terms of content, I've already covered it all in the previous posts. It's split between some live music to start and some general neighborhood photography using the fisheye lens for the second half.

One thing I wanted to point out that I didn't in the fisheye one is the picture in the bottom right, second from the right. The pink at the top of the frame is strange to me. I have no idea what exactly caused that to happen. It's one of the last pictures on the roll and nothing around it has that effects so it's definitely a bit of a mystery to me.

I'd also like to state about that picture in the bottom right, I didn't expect the exposure to turn out like that. I eexpected a significantly darker frame. It's probably about 2 or 3 stops brighter than I was expecting or wanting. I'd like to blame that on me not metering properly but this is definitely one of those pictures where having an in camera meter that works would be helpful. There are a couple rolls coming up where I'd also like having a working in camera meter so maybe I should spend the money to just get a separate meter instead of fussing around with my phone. Most of the time it works out the way I expect and want, but sometimes it feels really awkward to swap.

In terms of how I feel about the roll, I like it a fair amount, if it isn't obvious by the number of larger pictures. I do feel like I'm settling into another one of those pretty static points where I just feel comfortable about my picture taking. So maybe I should really commit more to other lenses and reorient myself before I get too comfortable.

One thing I will say is that this roll kind of gives away where I live more than I'd like, but whatever, I don't think anyone really reads these so it's not the end of the world. Anyways that's all for this roll. Onto the next.
