	<summary>Explanation</summary>
	
	Going into the night, I wasn't really too sure what shows I was going to see or how much I was going to be interested in taking pictures. The only bands on the list I knew I wanted to see were Die Spitz and Sin + Seraphim. Therefore, it's pretty fitting that about half of the roll went to Die Spitz and the other half went to Sin + Seraphim.<br><br>

	As you can tell, this pair of images are again of Sin + Seraphim. I already spent far too long talking about my thoughts on their music and performance in the other post so this post will be much more focused on these two pictures.<br><br>

	Clearly, these two pictures were taken at about the same time. They're right next to each other on the roll and were probably taken no more than a minute or two apart.<br><br>

	Structurally, they're quite similar, I'd argue they both follow that a/b structure that I've been trying to more consistently explore. That said, they're clearly very different from each other as well.<br><br>

	Before talking about the second, more interesting picture, I want to cover the baseline first picture. I really like this picture. The colors give me a really nice, moody and dark vibe. The grain is really warm and pleasing. I totally missed a piece of dust while scanning, oops. I'm not going to rescan because it's a pain in the butt and it's good enough. Anyways, that distraction aside, it's a really comfortable picture with very clear direction from left to right. The focus is sharpest to the left and tapers off but leaves the singer still entirely visible and legible. The one two three nature of the keyboard, soundpad, and singer is really nice and doesn't leave a large void in the middle of the picture. All in all, I think this is a really nicely executed picture with just the right level of dark and light. I would say that this picture is a better representation of my idea and also a better representation of Sin + Seraphim's work and style than the picture in the previous post.<br><br>

	Now, let's talk about the second picture. If you read back to the <a href="/2022/09/12/portra-800-1">Portra 800 (1st roll)</a> post, I mentioned briefly about a multiple exposure picture. This is one of those. I finally got my dad's Nikon FM back from the shop and really wanted to try it out so both this roll and the next one were shot with it. I won't go over multiple exposure pictures too much here except to say that this is one. I really want to go over a handful of them in the next post so I'll explain and talk about them more mechanically there.<br><br>

	As a multiple exposure picture, this one has 3 exposures on the same frame. You can track this most easily with the singer as she shifts across the stage. Before going further, I'm going to just outright say that I like this picture more than the previous one. While I really like the simplicity and clarity of that picture, this one feels a lot more vibrant and expressive without feeling overly cluttered. Part of this I think is because one of the three frames has the singer superimposed over the laptop(s) which really mutes that one's presence. Interestingly, I think if I had been more exact with where I held the camera, it might have turned out too cluttered as that overlap wouldn't occur.<br><br>

	In terms of vibrancy and expressiveness, I really like seeing multiple poses and facets of the main singer in one frame. It's a really unique interaction and there's a motion to it, even though each frame is just on top of the other. It maintains the vibe and moodiness of the first picture but adds a ghostliness and delicate nature that's not as apparent or obvious. It's really interesting seeing some of the lights spotlight through the partial frames and the interactions are really fun and playful.<br><br>

	That said, I would still probably say that the first picture is a more representative picture of Sin + Seraphim. The mood is just perfect and the second picture does flirt with being too much. Ultimately that's a risk with multiple exposure pictures. I'll go over that some more in the next post so I think I'll leave this one here.
