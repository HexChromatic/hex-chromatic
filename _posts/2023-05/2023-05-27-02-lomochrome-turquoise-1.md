For the second roll post, here's the Lomochrome Turquoise in all its color shifting weirdness. A bit like the Lomochrome Purple, this film is all about changing colors from one to another. As with other half frame rolls, I'm not gonna spend the time to make the pictures bigger or smaller, it's simply too much effort for not enough gain. I reserve the right to do so, but generally I won't because it's a lot.

Obviously, one of the first things to talk about are the colors. The most obvious is that all the skies are orange. The next thing to point out is that human skin is blue, you can see this most notably in some of the pictures towards the end of the roll when I got back to Austin and was trying to finish out the roll. Perhaps even more than Lomochrome Purple, Turquoise really mixes up the colors, almost inverting them while keeping black and white intact. It's a really bizarre and weird thing to experience.

The second thing to note is how bright a lot of these pictures are. It really feels like I metered incorrectly. A lot of the skies are really blown out. However, thinking this through I realized that I really do need to approach the skies differently. It's ok if they're blown out, but I would like to do so on purpose rather than on accident as is happening here. I mentioned this in a previous post, but I do appreciate this accidental "mis-metering". My best guess as to why this happened though is because this film is one of those extended range rolls and I metered as if it were ISO 200. Maybe it ended up exposing closer to 400?

Like the previous roll, I did end up liking about half of the pictures. There are more experimental and outright weird pictures here. So it's a bit impressive that even with some of the craziness and imperfections I still really enjoyed this roll. I definitely loved getting these pictures back and looking at how crazy the colors looked.

While there are a few pictures that are really poorly focused, in general I do feel like I've gotten much more of a hang of the distances and focus of this camera so it definitely feels more natural than the first time I took pictures with it. And as I said during those rolls, I take different sorts of pictures with this camera. They tend to be a bit more experimental but also a bit more intentionally pedestrian. Even still, there are a lot of interesting things to see here. I like a lot of the spaces and minor things I caught here. Sydney really is a beautiful city and I really hope I managed to capture some of that in these pictures.

At the end of the roll are a few more Blanton related pictures but I'm not super interested in talking about those so I'll just leave it here.
