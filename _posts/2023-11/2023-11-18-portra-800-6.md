For this next roll I've got some more Milky Way pictures from outside Santa Fe and two shows that have very similar colors.

This set of Milky Way pictures is quite a bit different from the previous ones. The coloration is significantly more orange and yellow which I haven't really seen much of when looking at Milky Way pictures. My understanding of this is twofold. One, I took these pretty close to sunset and two, there are clouds on the horizon. The clouds are reflecting light from Santa Fe and probably the sunset further away. It's a really interesting effect honestly. As should be obvious these were also taken with the fisheye lens which meant an even longer exposure, considering the widest aperture of f/2.8 compared to f/1.4 for the 50mm, so maybe that's part of it too.

Honestly I like these Milky Way pictures a lot. They don't feel like a lot of other ones I've seen. Partially due to the color scheme but also the inclusion of clouds which aren't usually there. I will say that I'm disappointed in the satellite trails but that's a consequence of our corporate overlords taking over the night sky. I'll leave that there and move on.

Next up is the set of pictures under the Milky Way on the right side. These were taken at a really interesting show featuring mostly ambient and electronic focused artists. The most interesting part though was that it was a quadraphonic sound setup which meant that there were 4 sets of speakers each playing a different channel creating a truly unique sound space that was a treat to walk around in even though many people didn't.

In terms of pictures, they're a bit whatever. I was trying to make use of a 105mm lens but there was a mishap part way through the show so I had to back out the film then reload it. Honestly I'm a bit surprised the roll didn't get really messed up in the process. As far as I can tell the only real odd spot is the double exposure that crossed multiple sets entirely on accident.

Lastly are some pictures of Lena Luca in the bottom left and Swiss Banks in the bottom right. Overall, I like these pictures. I think I may have wanted to cut down on the light a bit here or there but honestly I really need to get a stand alone meter. While metering with a phone is fine in general, these kinds of fine metering are difficult and awkward to do with a phone.

Out of these pictures I only want to talk about one. It's the one second from the left in the bottom row. It's so close but ultimately I didn't make it work. The idea was to do a double exposure from different sides of the stage to make it look like a pair of clones singing towards each other look. But I didn't properly orient the exposures so they overlap each other. It's definitely one I want to try again so I'll be looking for an opportunity sometime next year to figure it out.
