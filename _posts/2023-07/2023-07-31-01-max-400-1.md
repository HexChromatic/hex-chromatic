For this roll post we have another film stock, Kodak Max 400. I got this set of 3 rolls in Sydney while I was there. It's a 24 exposure roll instead of 36 which is why the collage ends up as odd as it is. In terms of its content, this covers Alex Lahey and two sets of a show that includes Austin based Sad Cell and Pons from the earlier post.

Overall, I'm not super happy with this roll. While I do like some of the Alex Lahey pictures, most of them turned out a bit blurry or just off in general. I spent a lot of time focusing on the guitarist to Alex Lahey's right. I do like some of these pictures, they're very animated and some of them are quite fun. But overall, I just feel a bit meh about them.

In regards to the Sad Cell pictures, they're fine. I just don't think they're special at all. This kind of continues into the next roll but I'll talk more about that there.

For the Pons pictures, there aren't too many of them. I mentioned in that post that the distance was tight enough that you could almost make it vertical and on the right side of the collage there's an example of just that. This picture has its focus to the back instead of the front and overall it works, but it has less impact than the one I describeed in that post.

In terms of color and film grain, it's fine. I think that the colors are pretty accurate even though this was pushed one stop. The film grain is still pretty tight and looks quite good.

Ultimately I'm just not that interested in this roll overall, it's just a bit meh. So I'm just gonna end it here.
