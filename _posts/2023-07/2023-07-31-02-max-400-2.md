This roll covers the second roll of Kodak Max 400. It was also pushed one stop and covers the second half of the night that started with Sad Cell and Pons. That means it has Austin based Fawn and Shooks. Additionally it covers a collection of Lena Luca pictures including the two I posted about earlier.

Like the previous roll, this one includes 26 total pictures on a roll rated for 24 exposures. The colors and grain are pretty similar overall so I won't cover those more particularly.

While the last roll was pretty meh, this one isn't really that much better. I'm definitely happier with it than the previous roll. But not meaningfully.

I think the Lena Luca pictures are interesting and while I don't like all the pictures I appreciate what I tried to do in all of them. I think the image conception there was more fully formed and a big part of that was the lighting and venue. It should be pretty obvious that the lighting is more varied and interesting in those as compared to the first half. The pictures of Fawn and Shooks, along with Sad Cell and Pons from the last roll, were all taken at The Mohawk's indoor stage. It's a pretty small stage and honestly it often has really flat lighting. As a result, it's not really my favorite venue to take pictures at.

I'm not really sure I have much else to say about this set of pictures so I think I'll just leave it here.
