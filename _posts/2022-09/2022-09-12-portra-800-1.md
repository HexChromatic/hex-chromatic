For the more attentive, this roll looks really different from the other ones I've shot so far. That's because during the film processing step, this roll was "pushed" 1 stop. This means that the film was in the developing solution longer than it was intended which results in it being "overexposed". In practical terms, it means you can shoot 1 stop faster than normal. Or said in another way, instead of shooting 800 ISO as this film was originally intended, I shot it as 1600 ISO. The opposite of this would be called "pulling" which would cut it back the other direction, 400 ISO instead of 800 ISO.

This is my first time having my film pushed so I wasn't sure exactly what effect it would have. As far as I can tell, it made the film quite a bit grainier, as you would expect. It also made the colors less saturated and did some amount of hue shifting. It's not super clear how consistent that hue shifting is and it seems as though the lighting conditions significantly affect that hue shifting so I'll have to try this out more in the future.

In regards to this roll, I kind of knew it would be a bit of a mess. The first picture was taken back in August and is an example of a multiple exposure picture. Unfortunately, it wasn't super steady so there's more side to side shifting than I'd like. Like pushing film, I'd like to do more multiple exposure type pictures as they're a thing that isn't strictly possible in digital, though you can do things similar with long exposures and flash.

You'll also notice that this roll doesn't have a whole lot of pictures for a 36 exposure roll. This is mostly due to that issue I pointed out on my dad's Nikon FM that I mentioned in the previous roll post. As a result, I switched over this roll to my other camera. As a result, it seems like there my have been some strange light leaking going on with some of the first pictures in addition to a few of the first pictures being completely exposed.

In terms of the show that this roll captures, it was a show I went to at Empire shortly before going on a week long trip. The first few pictures are of daysormay, a band I wanted to see back in March for SXSW but didn't get a chance to. Next was Will Joseph Cook followed by the headliner of the night, Tessa Violet.

All in all, it was a fun show and though I don't really like the pictures overall that much, it was enjoyable. I think I didn't pay enough attention to where the pole was in a lot of the pictures I took. I was standing on the right side of the stage and it's in a bunch of the pictures which I didn't expect considering I'm usually more attentive of that.

That said, it was a super packed show and also a really young one. Though I'm not old by any means, this show was clearly more of a college/high school crowd than any of the other shows I went to and I definitely felt a bit old as a result. It's definitely not something I've thought too much about recently, but it's definitely true that time continues to march forward and it may be one of those things I feel more often.

Anyways, that's it for this roll, I honestly don't really care much about how well or poorly this roll went considering some of the difficulties and me trying to push the film.
