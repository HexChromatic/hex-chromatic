Writing this at the beginning of December I have a lot of catching up to do. This roll covers 3 shows starting with an Urban Heat/Vision Video show at Elysium all the way back at the beginning of August, the Goodyfest show I mentioned in the previous post, and half a show at Valhalla. I'll just cover them in order for ease.

Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of the pictures I took of Urban Heat this time around. Overall, they're a bit pedestrian and a bit too Jonathan Horstmann focused. Nothing necessarily wrong with that, there are some powerful poses and some fun setups. But overall a bit one note.

Next up is Vision Video. They were good. The pictures overall are a bit more varied and I'm happier with them overall. The picture I'm personally most interested in is the one second from the top and second from the right. It's got a lot of motion blur but each bit of it is distinct. I don't think it's a double exposure so I'm wondering if the lights were flickering. I had to have known the blur was going to happen but I'm honestly not surehow exactly that effect came to be. Based on the trailing motion I assume it's just a longer exposure in the 1/8 to 1/2 second range. It just seems like a lot of motion for that kind of time frame.

After that is the collection of pictures from Goodyfest. I was caught a bit off guard when Lady Dan pulled out the bubble machine at the end of their set so that picture ended up blurrier than I wanted. That picture is on the left side second in and 4 from the top. Besides that, I mentioned it in the previous post, I wanted to explicitly take more A/B split type pictures where the close subject was on the right. There's also one of the pictures of Glare in the middle of the collage that's intentionally skewed. I want to play more with intentionally skewed pictures so it'll be a bit more common in the future as I grapple a bit with what effect that has and what I can do with it.

Lastly, in the bottom right corner is the Flyer Club, Swimwear Department, and Big Bill show at Valhalla. It was an interesting show and I had a lot of fun. Swimwear Department's a weird band from Houston that only sings about two topics, pools and malls. Flyer Club has a song called "Stretching" that turns into an impromptu stretching session with the crowd. Big Bill strongly encourages crowd surfing but doesn't have the kind of raucous crowd a metal or punk show typically has. Altogether a fun show. In terms of the pictures here, there's only some bits of Flyer Club and Swimwear Department, Big Bill's on the next roll. Overall, it was a mixed bag of a set in terms of pictures. I tried to capture some of the goofiness of the show but I don't think I did it justice honestly.

Overall though, I do like how this roll turned out. It's split pretty evenly between big and small pictures. There's a reasonable amount of variation and there's definitely a good bit of experimentation on my part in regards to the types of images I went for. I've got a lot of pictures and rolls to talk about from the past couple months and I'll try to get through them before the end of the year before getting to the big A/B split post and the year in review post.
