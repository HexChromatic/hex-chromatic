	<summary>Explanation</summary>

	Continuing on, I want to talk about another pair of pictures of <i>Austin</i>. Unlike the previous post, this one will likely be a fair bit shorter since I've already talked a lot so I'll focus mostly on just these pictures specifically.<br><br>

	I've been to <i>Austin</i> probably 8 to 10 times since it opened in 2018 and each time I'm always looking for something I've never seen before. To do so, I spend a lot of time looking at what other people are looking at. While most people look at and take pictures of the main features, every so often you'll find someone really trying to take things in and explore the space.<br><br>

	These pictures are the result of my looking at someone else. While I've always known that the marble slabs on the wall can reflect the light, I've never thought about taking pictures of that reflection like I have here. Catching the woman on either side is also a nice connecting point that pulls the two pictures together even more.<br><br>

	What I find interesting about these pictures in comparison to the one in the previous post is how orange the ambient light is. It almost looks like sunset even though this pair was taken maybe an hour or two after that picture, 10 in the morning compared to close to noon.<br><br>

	The film grain is really pronounced, in a way that's maybe a bit distracting. At the end of the day though, there's not much I can do about that, nor is there anything I want to do about it. Film grain is a function of the conditions and film and it's not something I want to erase. Well, that's all for this post, there might be more posts about <i>Austin</i> in the future, but it'll be a fair bit from now.
