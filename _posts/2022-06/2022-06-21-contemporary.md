	<summary>Explanation</summary>

	Here's a quick one. This picture is a pretty simple one I took of the Contemporary Austin (Jones Center) during my morning commute.<br><br>

	I take the bus, not because I can't drive but because I choose not to drive. During my commute, I pass by the Contemporary and knew I wanted to take this picture so I went for it this day. I needed a sunny day when I was carrying my camera and this was the day.<br><br>

	It's not a particularly complicated picture, I just needed to wait for the sun to align right so it wouldn't blow out the picture and took the picture. Taking pictures through windows is always fun and I think in this case adds a kind of ephemeral effect that is pretty nice.<br><br>

	If you're wondering what's going on with the walls, The Contemporary was hosting an exhibit of Daniel Johnston, hence the drawings. That's all, short post.
