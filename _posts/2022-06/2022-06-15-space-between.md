	<summary>Explanation</summary>

	This is a post about the space between. The space between what? Anything. In this case, between two adjacent buildings. Honestly, this is a pretty poor picture. As a result, I'm gonna retry this picture on my next roll.<br><br>

	Sometimes when you walk past something, you get an urge to stop and think and this is one of those weird places. For much of the day I was thinking about the space between things and what a picture of that looks like. Or rather, not just what it does look like, but how far can that picture be taken. How far can you take the space between things before it no longer looks like the space between?<br><br>

	For context, I was walking past this around lunchtime and it was somewhat cloudy. I thought there was enough of a difference in light to create sharp shadows but I think I misjudged my meter due to it being a center weighted average. As a result, there isn't much of a difference and I feel more than a bit disappointed with this picture.<br><br>

	I don't think the idea itself is bad though, which is why I'm retrying it on a sunnier day and with more care towards metering the way I need to. I do want to spend some further time contemplating what exactly it is that intrigues me about this space between two buildings.<br><br>

	Unlike a landscape or live music, this is perhaps a weird picture to even think about. There's nothing intrinsically interesting going on here. It's just a gap. I think it's because the gap is naturally neglected. It's often unseen or unthought of and perhaps that's why it's interesting to me. Not because it's intrinsically interesting, but because in some ways it isn't but that makes me want to capture it in a way that makes it feel striking or bizarre.<br><br>

	These posts labelled 'bad' are more for me to explore my own thoughts and mark a specific thought and a specific image as one to retry or further explore. Maybe the next one also won't work out, but I have a feeling it'll look quite different from this one and that in itself is exciting.
