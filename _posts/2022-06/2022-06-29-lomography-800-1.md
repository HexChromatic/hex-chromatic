As I said in the first post on this roll, this roll turned out really well. Better than any roll I've shot so far and better than the upcoming couple rolls as well. I think a good part of that is that I was playing pretty heavily into my comfort zone but I also think I had a good idea of the pictures I wanted to take as I was taking them.

In terms of numbers, I only had 5 that I outright disregarded as bad and additionally only 12 that I thought were just sort of ok. I took 4 that I thought were great, ones that definitely wow'd me a bit right when I saw them. Everything else was solid and had something I really enjoyed or made me think.

As much as that should make me happy, I should try to aim for images that interest me after all, I also find myself a bit sad. More than anything I'm a bit sad that I didn't try anything too crazy. Everything kind of just fit and worked. Obviously there's nothing wrong with that necessarily, but I still feel like there's a lot of space for me to learn and adapt in shooting film and a roll like this is a bit of a let down in that way.

Instead of actively trying something different, these pictures are just...good. While there are surprises in here that I can learn from, the lighting in particular during the Parker Chapin and Katie Touin shows, they just sort of work. I thought I had thrown in some pictures that would be more intense or more experimental but none of the pictures ended up quite that way.

The next couple of rolls don't really change that, though there's a good bit to talk about in regards to those rolls as well.

While there's a lot of pictures in here I didn't talk about in their own posts, I don't really feel like going through any of the remaining ones. That said, I will point out the bananas which was a fun way to cap the Katie Toupin show.
