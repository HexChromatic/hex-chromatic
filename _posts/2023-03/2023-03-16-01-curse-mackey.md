	Another short one hopefully. This one's about Curse Mackey.<br><br>

	Like the last Curse Mackey picture, this was taken at Elysium and this one is honestly really simple. Unlike the last time I took pictures of Curse Mackey, this time he had lights set up at the front of the stage pointing towards each other. I intentionally waited, and almost blinded myself, for when he'd cross to catch this picture.<br><br>

	There isn't a whole lot of detail to the picture due to the really strong difference in light between the bright lights he's blocking and him. I do like that his gear setup is fully cloaked by the light and overall the vibe works just right.<br><br>

	One thing I'm not entirely sure about is what that red square on the right side of the picture is. No clue. (Edit from the future, I think that's an exit sign) Anyways that's it for this post, let's keep going.
