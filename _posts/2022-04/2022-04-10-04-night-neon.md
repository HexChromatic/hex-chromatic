    <summary>Explanation</summary>

    A few months ago I read a compilation of short stories by Joyce Carol Oates. As a collection, it is filled with some at times disturbing tales. Of them, one is very deeply tied to the allure and potentially destructive nature that neon can entail. While I may not encourage everyone to read the book, the stories are generally well written but can meander or be quite extreme at times, I did find myself thinking about some portions of the book. The eponymous story is definitely a drawn out affair chronicling a woman's dsyfunctions, each related in some way to neon lights. While I don't personally believe I share those sorts of destructive tendencies concerning neon lights, I do find myself drawn to them.<br><br>

    For these pictures, I wanted to reflect some of those at times inviting, at times dangerous feelings that neon lights can express. The first picture of the group was taken on the first night of SXSW and is probably my favorite of the bunch. There's something gritty and almost seedy to the picture. I think that mostly comes from mostly seeing the shadows of people in the picture. While a couple of people are lit, most only have a tiny bit of light, if any, shining on them. If you're paying attention, it's clear that Hoboken Pie is a pizza place, distributing slices out a window. But with all the occluding shadows, it could just as well be a less than reputable institution. I find that dichotomy quite interesting and that is why this is my favorite of the bunch.<br><br>

    For the next three pictures, I took them all in Amarillo in pretty close proximity. While the Paramount sign is quite alluring and this particular angle does it a couple favors, overall I find the picture a bit dull story wise. It's an ok picture, but it doesn't tell a particularly powerful or interesting story. I will say that the color is striking and that the reflection off the building is quite appealing.<br><br>

    In regards to the last couple of pictures, I find them quite odd. On the one hand, the lighting comports a very comforting and lively environment. On the other, there aren't any people. There's just a single car in the first one and no one and nothing in the second. The lighting betrays the idea that these should be bustling, high foot traffic areas. Instead, it's a ghost town. Now, to be fair, these pictures were taken on Sunday night and relatively late at that, around 10pm or so. It's also important to note that Amarillo doesn't really do Sundays, as in most places are closed on Sunday, I assume for religious reasons. Had I taken these pictures on Saturday, perhaps the streets would've been filled with people and these pictures would feel entirely different.
