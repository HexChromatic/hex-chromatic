	<summary>Explanation</summary>

	Next roll, two pictures of the space between.<br><br>

	For the first picture we have that same area but on a different day. The contrast between the left and right side draws attention. Additionally, the angle works a bit better looking straight on rather than up. Adding the floor creates a grounding point so the picture doesn't feel in the middle of empty space.<br><br>

	For the second picture there's a different place. This one works better in my opinion. There's a strong and specific center point with the sun in the middle. The imbalance in height between the left and right sides creates instability that is interesting to look at. The right side being really dark but reflective additionally creates contrast and texture that doesn't exist in the first picture.<br><br>

	Ultimately, the main point of these pictures is recognizing that there's always something to look at and something to find interesting. It may not always be the best, but sometimes the space between will uncover something you didn't expect.
