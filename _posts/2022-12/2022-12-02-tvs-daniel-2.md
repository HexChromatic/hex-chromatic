	Up next is this pair of pictures also taken from that TV's Daniel show. Before talking about the pictures though, I want to talk about TV's Daniel since I didn't in the last post.<br><br>

	TV's Daniel is really hard for me to describe. Their recorded music, of which there's only two tracks, don't at all do justice to their live performance. Listening only to their recorded music, you'd think that they're some sort of indie pop type act with maybe a bit of rock. Instead, I might describe them, and more particularly the eponymous Daniel as a performing arts group that happens to play music. The persona of Daniel is as an egotistical musician famous for being on TV even though the reality, at least at the moment, is much less the case. The kind of overblown confidence and slight mania is really oddly enjoyable to watch, especially in contrast to the band which seems to just go on playing in the background without much of a care to the front man's antics.<br><br>

	With that said, let's dig into this pair of pictures. As I said in the previous post, these are examples of pictures where I tried to add more subjects into the frame. While I did try this multiple times this year, I don't really think I succeeded particularly often. These, while better than the majority are still not quite what I want, though the second picture is pretty close.<br><br>

	For the first picture, I think this is actually also pretty close. However, I think what breaks this picture for me is the empty space with the crowd. Arguably, this could be a good thing, but for me it pulls me out of the relationships between the rest of the subjects in the frame. The focus is set towards the middle, on the bassist and Daniel, even if he's partly out of frame. However, I keep getting drawn straight into the void space with the crowd which completely throws off my particular enjoyment of the picture. I won't say it's a bad picture, but it's definitely one that I personally feel has a critical flaw that makes it not what I was really aiming for. Honestly, trying to juggle when to take this picture, I'm not sure if I'd ever notice that until getting it back so I won't beat myself up too much, it's just a bit unfortunate.<br><br>

	Now onto the second picture. Oddly, I feel like this picture works better. I have literally no idea where the focus point for this picture is. My best guess is that it's really close but what confuses me is that the back wall is clear enough to read. Either way, I like this picture more than the other one almost exclusively because that void space is largely gone. While there's still a space between Daniel and the guitarist to the right which has a person in it, this is less egregious to me. I think because there isn't a gap in the middle, my eyes go left to right into the frame, exactly as I intended. Even though there is a gap to the right, it's at the end of the sight line so it doesn't pull in. Additionally, because there isn't a sharp focus point surrounding it, I'm not inclined to go directly into that area. What I will say is I wish I were maybe standing a bit further back or a bit further left to get a bit more of the left guitarist. That's ultimately a nitpick though and I think that although this picture is entirely fuzzy, it works really well.<br><br>

	That's it for this post. One more, then the roll post.
