I think it's pretty clear that the colors on this roll are a bit strange. Especially considering that this was shot on Lomography 800, which while vibrant and satured, has pretty respectable colors. Like the Portra 800 a bit ago, this roll was pushed 1 stop, from 800 to 1600. Apparently, under these conditions daylight scenes are pretty normal. However, under lower light situations, there's a pretty noticeable yellow tinge. To be fair, the lights weren't a neutral white color, so there's that. However, it's still a pretty extreme color effect on display here.

As seen by the number of larger pictures, I actually really like this roll. TV's Daniel really surprised me. As a band I hadn't heard of before the show, they put up a really good show and had an energy that definitely left me a fan by the end of the night. I also felt really good about a lot of the pictures of them that I took. Enough so that I could've written a lot more about them but decided not to.

One post I was debating writing is about the pair of pictures with the bassist and drummer just about in the center of this collage. Instead I'll just briefly talk about them here. While I like the dynamism of the bassist's pose in the left picture, I think I like the right picture more. I think that the left picture has a bit too much negative space that sucks attention away. Both pictures are set up in that split half structure I described in the first TV's Daniel post but in portrait instead of landscape. When set up like this, the z axis is more pronounced. It's really apparent where the front and back here and the relation is really strong.

As far as I can remember of TV's Daniel's set, I don't remember the lighting changing throughout the set in any significant way. However, there are clearly two differently colored sets of pictures, one more orange and the other very yellow. I'm very curious about that and wonder if I just wasn't attentive enough to the base color of the frame. I neither remember a significant yellow or a significant orange so the colors are pretty odd to me.

What I will say is that the darkest pictures here are about the right colors. So maybe it's more that cool colors are preserved better than warm ones when Lomography 800 is pushed.

In terms of how I feel about this roll, I really like it overall. I think it's a nice return to a blend of safe pictures and experimental ones. Along with exploring pushing film more, I think that it's got a good amount of risk to it. If I'm really thinking about it, I think part of the reason why it's better than say the 2nd Lomography 800 roll, is because Hotel Vegas' stage, where these pictures were shot, is more similar to Empire's compared to either 3Ten ACL Live or Antone's. What I mean by that is the size of the stage mostly. It's a pretty tight stage and as a result the individual band members are necessarily closer together. This makes visual relationships closer together in the frame and makes making relationships easier in a frame.

Just a couple more posts until I'm caught up.
