This roll of Fujifilm Fujicolor 200, which I'll just shorten to Fuji 200, was not taken on my normal camera. Before explaining that, if I shoot any other Fuji film of a different branding, e.g. Superia, I'll say Fuji Superia instead of just Fuji. Instead of the Minolta X-370 that I've been shooting on up until this point, this entire roll was shot on a Nikon FM with a 50mm lens.

There's a bit of a short story behind this, both the camera and this roll. This camera's actually one of my dad's old cameras that he got in the 70s. When I said I was starting to shoot film, he graciously gave me this camera that he was no longer using, and so my camera collection steadily grows.

In terms of the story behind this roll, this is actually the "second" roll of film I shot with this camera. The first roll I never got developed because it was a bit of a disaster. One, I didn't originally load it correctly, so I didn't even take pictures when I thought I was. Two, in figuring that out, I ended up exposing it to a bunch of excess light so even if I did develop it, it's likely it'd just be all white. And three, there's currently an issue with the camera where the advancing lever would occasionally get stuck and trigger inconsistently. I'm writing this post in December and am trying to get it fixed but it's at a local camera repair shop so here's hoping that gets fixed.

Anyways, this is the second roll. Shot trying to see if that issue I just stated was a real thing or not.

The pictures on this roll are all either taken at The Contemporary Austin at Laguna Gloria or at the nearby Mayfield Park, which as can be seen, does have peacocks/peahens otherwise known as peafowl.

Overall, I wouldn't say this is a bad roll, but I wasn't particularly focused on taking great pictures or even interesting ones. I was mostly focused on two things. First, I was trying out the camera as a function of the issue. And two, I was trying the camera out as a function of it not having a working meter. Therefore, I was metering with my phone and was curious how comparable that was. As it turns out, metering with my phone was fine, things turned out pretty much the exact exposure as I expected, so no issues there. Also, as all the pictures did turn out, it seemed like there weren't any issues with the camera, though now writing this in the future, the issue was not really resolved or able to be worked around consistently.

While I did like some of the pictures on this roll honestly, I'm not too satisfied with these pictures. They're not bad, but not particularly memorable either, which as I said before is fine, given what I was doing with the roll.
